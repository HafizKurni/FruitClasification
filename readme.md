# 🍎 A Comparative Study of Convolutional Neural Networks and Vision Transformers for Fruit Classification

This project investigates the performance of **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **Vision Transformers (ViTs)** on the task of fruit classification. Leveraging a high-quality image dataset of fruits, the study evaluates and compares both model architectures based on per-class accuracy and detailed classification metrics.
